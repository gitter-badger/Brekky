Butter is an eCash to NuBits on/off ramping service that integrates with services such 
as OKPay and PerfectMoney to provide a way to purchase and sell NuBits away for 
traditional exchanges.

Toast is a burn service. It provides an API to prove destruction of NuBits. The 
intention is that other service providers can integrate with this to use a a 
paywall/gateway for content and/or services
